# react-translator-app
This is small React Translation app that was used for me to get a better understanding of React Hooks (useState, and useEffect)

The underlying stack used are:
* React (via create-react-app)
* AxiosJS to manage the API
* googleAPI - Cloud Translation
* Semantic-UI for styling

Running version can be seen here: https://5f5f3405a9ea4d2cf4e47d60--thirsty-murdock-d29519.netlify.app/

I probably will not be further developing this app, rather its more used to showcase my understanding of React, React Hooks, and API calls.
